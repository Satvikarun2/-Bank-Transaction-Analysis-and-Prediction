📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank transaction data to uncover spending patterns, detect anomalies, and build a predictive model to forecast future transactions. Leveraging Python and data science libraries, this project delivers insights that can assist financial institutions in risk assessment, user behavior profiling, and fraud prevention.

🎯 Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on transactional data

Identify high-spending customers and detect unusual behavior

Visualize trends in user transactions over time

Build a predictive model for transaction classification or anomaly detection

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas – for data manipulation

matplotlib / seaborn – for visualization

scikit-learn – for machine learning and evaluation

numpy – numerical operations

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes transaction records with the following fields:

Customer_ID

Transaction_Amount

Transaction_Type (Credit/Debit)

Date or Timestamp

Category or Merchant_Type

Note: Make sure to place the dataset in the appropriate path before running the notebook.

🔍 Key Features
EDA: Distribution plots, time-series trends, and category-wise spending

Segmentation: Grouping customers based on transaction behavior

Prediction: Classification model for fraud detection or transaction type prediction

Insights: Charts and summaries highlighting significant patterns

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository or download the .ipynb file

Ensure required libraries are installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Bank\ Transaction\ Analysis\ and\ Prediction.ipynb
Run cells sequentially from data loading to model evaluation.

📈 Output Highlights
Bar plots showing transaction volume by type

Monthly or daily transaction trends

Model accuracy and confusion matrix

Insights on spending categories and customer patterns

🔮 Future Work
Integration with big data tools like Apache Spark for real-time processing

Use of deep learning models for fraud detection

Streamlit or Flask-based dashboard for interactive insights
